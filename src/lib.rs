`mockerize-cli` is a simple subsection of the Mockerize project. Mockerize is an open-source, cross platform,
lightweight, server mocking application designed from the ground up to make creating mock development servers quick and painless.

Specifically, `mockerize-cli` focuses on provisioning quick server runtimes geared towards automation rather than the full
experience that the Mockerize application provides.
